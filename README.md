# Classification-Problem
This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using supervised machine learning techniques. The breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn is used, containing various tumor-related features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies.
